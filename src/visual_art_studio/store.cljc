  "SSoT for the ISCO-08 2651 independent visual artist / manga studio
  sole-proprietor actor. Store is a protocol injected into the
  `visual-art-studio.actor` StateGraph — `MemStore` is the default,
  deterministic, zero-dep backend; a Datomic/kotoba-server-backed
  implementation can be swapped in without touching the actor or governor
  (itonami actor pattern, per ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section).

  Domain:

    work     — a registered work/commission (:work/id, :work/title,
               :originals? whether physical originals exist)
    record   — a committed operating record under a work (page delivery,
               original shipment, artwork license) — written ONLY via
               commit-record!, never mutated in place
    ledger   — an append-only audit trail of every proposal/verdict/
               disposition, regardless of outcome (commit or hold)")
